# homebrew-cask-wmudge

Welcome to my little corner in the pub; these are my Casks for the [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask)
project.

# Usage

After you install Homebrew, run the following command:

```sh
$ brew tap wmudge/cask-wmudge
```

You can now install alternate versions of Casks.
